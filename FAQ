How do I produce `@' in LGrinded texts?

    Please RTFM. But since it comes up so often: use @@ in program text. To
    produce @ in LaTeX text in embedded listings mode you have to turn usage
    of @ off using a '%@-' comment. You can turn it on again using '%@+'.



How can I use filenames containing a `$'? This is rather important since
the `$' denotes the root directory under RISC OS.

    I really cannot figure out what exactly goes wrong. But at least I can
    offer a workaround. When using T1 or LY1 encoding there are no problems.
    Put \usepackage[x]{fontenc} (with x=T1 or x=LY1 and possibly others, but
    not OT1) in the preamble. (For standalone listings use firstpreamble in
    the lgrindef file.)



My source code doesn't seem to align properly. What am I doing wrong?

    LGrind uses by default a proportional font for its output. That's part
    of the beauty. However, aligning with spaces doesn't work, since they
    are relative horizontal motions. When using tabs, everything is fine. If
    the standard tab width of 8 is too big for you, fiddle around with your
    editor to save the file with tabwidth 4, say, and then use '-t 4' as an
    option to LGrind.



How do I activate line wrap?

    There is no line-wrap. LGrind has no way of knowing where a line break
    should be. It depends on the surrounding LaTeX, after all. Make your lines
    short enough to be pretty; or make your margins and font small.
