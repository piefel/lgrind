LGrind is used to format source code of different programming
languages for LaTeX.
 
LGrind is a major adaptation of Jerry Leichter's tgrind for LaTeX,
which was a notable improvement upon Van Jacobsen's tgrind for
plain TeX, which was adapted from vgrind, a troff prettyprinter.

LGrind contains non-free code written by Van Jacobson, who does not answer
to any request for changing his licence. This software is therefore not
maintained. I also do not accept any cheques anymore.
