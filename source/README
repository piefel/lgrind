These sources should compile without any problems.

The "access" function is declared in "io.h" or "unistd.h", depending on your
system. Replace "unistd" in "lgrind.c" with "io" if necessary. If your
compiler issues only a warning for missing prototypes you can delete the
#include completely. 


The -d! option is tested and works well. It writes a patched version of the
executable, run it at your own risk.
